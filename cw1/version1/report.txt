QUADTREE MODULES BREAKDOWN
The program consists of a main file for execution, a header file for the tree structure, a file containing all the functions for the modification of the quadtree,
as well as a corresponding header file used for importing the functions into the main.

EXPLINATION OF DESTROYNODE FUNCTION
If a node has no children, then the function will free the memory of the node, effectively destroying it. If the node has children, it will recurse through every
child node, and free them individiually (until it reaches the head of the node).
